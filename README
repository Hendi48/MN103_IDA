mn103 plugin for IDA

just some quick notes:

- the plugin was developed using IDA 4.7, so if you have that it should
  compile out of the box.
- if you have IDA 4.8 look at the comments in the code and modify it
  accordingly (uncomment the #define IDA_48 in reg.cpp)
- after compiling install the module in IDAs proc subdirectoy

if you get a "Bad Logic" warning, please report!
