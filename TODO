
- extended 0xf7 opcodes are missing, these are "vendor extensions" according
  to the datasheet. 
- extended 0xff opcodes are missing, these are "invalid" according to the
  datasheet, but appearently still used.
- all "user defined" opcodes are disassembled as such, should probably be
  disassembled in "clear text" once they are figured out
- the mn103.cfg is bogus... edit it to whatever you want, and use it if you like :)
